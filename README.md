# SimpleCal

## Overview
SimpleCal is an event and calendar plugin for WordPress. It's probably pretty basic, unless I've made it awesome but forgotten to update the README. It uses custom post types and some metadata to store event details, and then it displays them as a ~~widget~~ WordPress Block element or a shortcode.

It probably supports calendar views and agenda views, and it may even display detailed event data with a custom single post template. Who knows! Not me because I don't plan _shit_ when I code.

Probably a good time to say this is all unsupported and I wish you all the best with implementing this in your environment.

I love you all.
